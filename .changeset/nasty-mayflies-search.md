Adds support for "[CIP-66: New Transaction Type: Celo Denominated Fees](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0066.md)" on Celo. Note that this transaction type is only supported on Cel2 and can be created by adding the additional maxFeeInFeeCurrency field to your transaction params.
